# Chain Builder

This tool provides Autodesk Maya users a GUI to create a chain object.

## Script Setup

## User workflow

1. Run the chain_builder.py script
2. Select the chain link object via the "Chain Link Object" dropdown menu
3. Specify the number of links you want your chain to have in the "Number of Chain Links" field
4. Specify the distance between consecutive links in the "Distance Between Links" field
5. Select the direction of chain link generation by clicking one of the "Chain Orientation" radio buttons

## Future Work

- Allow chain objects to be created from NURBs polygons
- Add controls for pattern variation e.g. rotating every 2nd link 90 degrees with respect to the X-axis
- Add controls to let users create a curve that dictates the chain's path, then curve warp the chain to the curve
- Allow users to create chains featuring multiple distinct objects 
- Make it easier for users to edit the chain object after it's created e.g. to remove or add new chain links
